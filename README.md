# (The Homogeneous) Cow Maze

- This project is a 3D game built using C++ and OpenGL library as a course assignment.
- It is a game inspired by the 1989 DOS Game Chip's Challenge, where the player must collect chips to finish the levels, using keys, blocks and other tools to solve puzzles and reach their goal.
- The goal was also to practice CG concepts and 3D calculations (vectors, matrices, etc), studied during the course.

## Running the program

- To run the program you can execute the makefile located at the root of the project. Make sure to run it in a Linux-based OS, as a port for Windows was not implemented.
- Running the makefile should start the game immediately.
